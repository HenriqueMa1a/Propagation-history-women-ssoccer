### General Information

- This project is of my own authorship;
- What problem does it (intend to) solve? To raise information about something that is little talked about in the media and to encourage the younger athletes;
- What is the purpose of your project? Making even users who are not interested in the subject be moved and see things differently.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5;
- CSS3.

### Notes

- I needed the help of a coworker, as I had a setback in GitHub and didn't know how to solve it. The problem was to upload the code so that I can see the page of the site.
